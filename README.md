## UX
### Users
The user should be able to interact with the website freely and be able to visit the menu, book and reserve a table with a date/time of their choice. They will be able to also Sign up and login with an authenticated account that allows them to interact with their booking and write about their dietary requirements such as allergies etc.

This Site Application is for users who are fond of trying different recipes than what they are used to as well as different types of drinks.

Also giving them the option to create an account for future reference of handling all their reservations personally.
Only the user will be able to handle their own Reservation and cannot be edited by other users or staff members but Admins only.

### Admins
The Admins should be able to manage the bookings of the User, being able to approve, delete requests that are received from the booking.

The Admin can also apply the permissions for other staff members of what level of account they can have stored on the site. 
This will allow the employees to manage bookings and reservation requests made by users, Allowing for a flowing work system
rather than being handled by one individual.

### Agile Methodology

Agile Methodology was used via Github Projects Kanban board in order to create user stories and execute them as issues in a sprint fashion.

This was a good way to match the Sprint/Scrum like setup of real world Software development projects.
By Assigning tickets to myself in a 3 layered structure fashion, that being of Todo, In progress and Done, Helped me manage all the 
User story tasks in an arranged manner.

Settling tickets one by one and making sure all tasks are closed. Dealing with the tickets in this way give you focus and clear
target of how the large scale project can be executed in small projects one at a time making it not feel overwhelming.

In future projects of this same kind I can see the great benefits of a Kanban board like Github Projects and assigning tasks to other
developers to get the job done.

## Credits

SCOPE code credits to Code Institute, Django Blog Walkthrough Project. HTML template credit to Lucian Tartea. I have amended the code to my Restaurant sites specification.

Credits also due to Code Institute staff for helping especially Tutor Support. Special Shout out to Rebecca, Ed, Scott and Alex. I relied on them heavily during Crunch time and they pulled through and managed to help me when I was at breaking points.

Also special shouts to Tom from Slack Community. Life Save and helped guide me when it came to implementing Static files for my project.
